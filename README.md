# Covid19-Project
Hi, Mohammad Kumail Here. This is my first project created in python using data science.
In this project first we have an world wide dataset of the covid 19 cases.
The cases is like: Confirmed Cases, Deaths Cases, Active Cases, Recovered Cases with the latest date.
In the dataset first I clean the data with the help of 'Data Wrangling'.
Then, I filter the data with respect to the countries, provinces and find the cases.
In the last queries I draw the graphs with respect to the relevant categories of the cases.
